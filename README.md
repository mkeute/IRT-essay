# IRT-essay
Capstone project for a seminar in Item Response Theory @Uni Tuebingen

I analyzed an openly available dataset from the Sexual Compulsivity Scale (SCS) using item response theory (IRT) methods, following questions provided by our lecturer.
analysis.R contains the data analysis, essay.Rmd the essay.

The compiled PDF is in `essay.pdf`, the R-Markdown code that generates the essay is in `essay.Rmd`
