# IRT-essay
Capstone project for a seminar in Item Response Theory @Uni Tuebingen

I analyzed an openly available dataset from the Sexual Compulsivity Scale (SCS) using item response theory (IRT) methods, following questions provided by our lecturer.

The R-Markdown code that generates the essay is in `essay.Rmd`. The data analysis is done by `analysis.R`
